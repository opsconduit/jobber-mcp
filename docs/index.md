# OpsConduit Jobber MCP

Read-only Jobber reporting for owners who want a short action list without giving an AI tool write access.

## What It Produces

OpsConduit helps surface follow-up work that can be easy to miss:

- sent estimates older than 7 days
- overdue invoices
- active jobs with no upcoming visit
- draft estimates or requests that have stalled
- a short weekly owner action list

See the fictional sample output: [demo-output.md](demo-output.md)

## Why It Is Narrow

This project is deliberately not a broad automation tool. The default posture is:

- customer-hosted
- read-only
- no credential custody
- no autonomous writes to Jobber
- no customer data in public issues, docs, or email

## Pilot Setup

The paid pilot setup is for customers who want help installing the connector, authorizing Jobber, validating read-only access, and getting a first owner action list.
